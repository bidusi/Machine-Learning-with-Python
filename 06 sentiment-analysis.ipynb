This dataset contains 25,000 reviews from IMDB where each one is already preprocessed and has a label as either positive or negative. Each review is encoded by integers that represents how common a word is in the entire dataset. For example, a word encoded by the integer 3 means that it is the 3rd most common word in the dataset.\n"
